            <h1>Borderlands 3</h1>

            <p>
                Borderlands 3 is quite possibly the ultimate looter shooter that is out there. You can spend hours upon hours farming a boss and get a different gun everytime.<br>
                This on top of the four different classes you are able to play create tons of combinations for whatever you may be feeling. You can throw an infinite amount<br>
                of grenades, one shot powerful bosses, even become almost invincible. Even if you get bored of playing a certain way it is incredibly simple to just respec<br>
                your skill points and get a couple new guns that synergize. Also reaching the maximum potential of a bulid can give you quite the satisfaction.

        <h3>Zane</h3>

            <p>
                My go to character would have to be Zane the operator. I have about a total of 6 whole days played on my one Zane alone. One of the best builds in the game allows<br>
                you to keep 100% up time on your action skills. With the way his skills are creates a significant power spike allowing you to shred through any foe that dares<br>
                to cross your path. Since the release there has only been three different skill trees for zane, but with an upcoming dlc, there is going to be another one.<br>
                Right now we can only speculate about how good it may be, but if it is anything like his others, we are bound to have a great time.
