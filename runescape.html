            <h1>Oldschool Runescape</h1>
            <p>
                This classic game is one I have only recently gotten into. Mostly because it is mainly a computer game. They have made a mobile version but I believe<br>
                to truly experience the game to the fullest you should play on PC. There is a lot of stuff to do here all of it with the goal to make your account better.<br>
                The main way i have been going about it is to unlock a variety of different teleports because the map is quite large. You actually can't run across the <br>
                entire thing, you have to take a boat or two. Run energy is not unlimited either. Which leads me to the skills.

        <h3>Skilling</h3>
            <p>
                The main portion of the game is the different skills that you can train. They are quite the time sink even when getting the max exp possible. Your time<br>
                put into these skills will not go unrewarded however. On your way to any 99, you unlock new items, better skilling methods, new areas, and the most prestigious<br>
                is the cape you are able to get once you reach 99. It's really the ultimate flex, these capes give you special perks as well as an exclusive emote for ultimate<br>
                show-boating.
            </p>
        
        <h3>How much exp do you need</h3>
        <p>Here you can calulate how much more exp you'll need in order to reach level 99 in a certain skill.</p>

        <form>
            <fieldset>
                <label for="currentEXP">
                    Enter your current EXP
                </label>
                <input type="number" id="currentEXP">
            </fieldset>
            <fieldset>
                <button type="button" id="button">Calculate EXP</button>
            </fieldset>
            <fieldset>
                <p>Remaining EXP</p>
               <p id="remainingEXP"></p>
             </fieldset>
        </form>

        <script>
            function expCalculater() {
                var currentEXP = document.getElementById("currentEXP").value;
                var remainingEXP = 13034431 - currentEXP;
                document.getElementById("remainingEXP").innerHTML = remainingEXP;
            }
            document.getElementById("button").addEventListener("click", expCalculater, false);
