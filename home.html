            <h2>The Gist</h2>
            <p>This website was made with the intent to inform people about certain games, give my professional opinion, as well as a guide for a variety of different games.</p>
            <p>There may also be updates on my progression through which ever game I am playing at some period of time.</p>

        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>This is a short description about myself and my credentials.</p>
        <p>I am an 18 year old college student who has been palying games for as long as I can remember. My first taste of gaming was with the origanl Nintendo Ds.<br>
            Playing a few games such as nintendogs and Bookworm. Eventually I finally was able to play some games on the xbox 360, mostly a bunch of singleplayer games<br>
            that I can't really remember. Since the end of middle school though I have been playing mobile games like Clash of Clans and Brawl Stars. Slowly, through freinds,<br>
            I was introduced to games like Battlefield and Call of Duty. This sparked my competitive drive. Now i am always trying to get better at any sort of competitive game<br>
            I can get my hands on. Always striving to get every achievement available as well as any collectibles there may be.
