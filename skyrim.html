            <h1>The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim</h1>
            <p>
                Skyrim, the triple A game from Bethesda games studios is one that is near and dear to my heart. Coming out after the beloved Oblivion, Bethesda really stepped<br>
            it up a few nothes with this one. This RPG is a memorable one. From the seemingly endless landscape to the multitude of storylines, you most certainly will find<br>
            something you will love here. Not to mention the dragons, charater progression, differnet combat styles, magic, more mythical creatures than I can name here.<br>
            One of the most memorable things for me would be the soundtrack, more specifically the title screen song. It truly gives me goosbumps everytime.

        <h2>My Experince With the Game</h2>

        <p>
            I have put plenty of hours into the game on my ps4. A majority of it into my dagger wielding, sneak thief, khajiit. I have gotten every achievement there is with<br>
            him. He can easyily take on any foe that crosses his path being able to go completely invisable to come up behind them and stabbing them in the back. Fights do<br>
            do not last long here. I have ventured into every skill there is and must say playing with just my daggers can be a struggle early on. Most certainly one of the<br>
            more difficult play styles to get going. This however is very satisfing to take out an entire camp from the shadows.
