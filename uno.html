            <h1>Uno</h1>
            <p>Uno, the freindship ruining, luck of the draw game. Very easy to pick up hard to put down. With rules a 2 year old can understand this is truly a game for<br>
                everyone from the hardcore, super competitive players, to a few freinds just looking to have a good time. My experience with uno is one of victory. I find<br>
                I find myself often winning no matter the opponent. This isn't simply because they are bad, but rather, I am good. Now how can someone be "good" at a game<br>
                that relies on a decent bit of luck. Well, as someone who is relatively good at math, it's quite simple.

        <h3>Some tips from a pro</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Knowing some simple probability: Looking at the cards you have and the cards that have been played is a quick, simple way to find a good card to play.<br>
                If you are counting and really paying attention then this can become a very useful tool to help you win more games.</li>
                <li>Saving wild cards: This one is pretty self explainitory. DON'T imediatly use your wild, sometimes even drawing a card from the deck can be a better<br>
                play. With wilds being the best card you can have when it come down to you having uno, hollding on to one may be your key to success.</li>
            </ol>
